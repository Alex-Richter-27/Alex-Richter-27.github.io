        <h1><b>My Favorite Types of Music</b></h1>

        <p><b>1. Rock and Roll</b>
        	I've always been a fan of rock and roll because I first started listening to the Beatles when I was very young. Other bands that I loved from the rock and roll genre consist of Green Day, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Boston, Coldplay, The White Stripes, Foo Fighters, etc. Although I have loved rock and roll it isn't one othe catagories I have listened to recently.
