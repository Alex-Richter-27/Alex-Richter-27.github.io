        	<b> 1. Marketing </b> 
        		<i>I've like learning about Marketing every since I took a class in my junior year of High School. I've thought that marketing is very intresting because I learned from that class that it mostly consists of how to almost manipulate costomers and comsumers into buying your products and getting them to sell for a higher price than what they may actually be worth. </i> <IMG SRC="marketing6030.jpg">

        	<b> 2. Accounting </b>
        		<i>Accounting is something I only strated learning about a year ago. I took a class in High School in my senior year because I was interested to see if accounting was actually boring or not. I really liked the subject because I love math and it's fairly easy for me so I liked it. It's also very interesting how knowing just the basics of Accounitng I know how to write a check, how money goes in and out of a company/business and how the money of any business should work properly. </i> <IMG SRC="accounting3020.jpg">
